To do:
p5: is the plot with MC QCD better ? To try....
Anne-Marie: for the top plot only
Anne-Marie: p10 and 11 I would still copy into your style, not just copy like that ;) The boxes in red are the speaker's own views...
Patrick Dunne: I don't know where he got the plots from though
Anne-Marie: ask them to Sasha
Anne-Marie: this is Sasha's stuff
Anne-Marie: do you understand the methods ?
Patrick Dunne: I understand method 2, and I think I understood method 1 at one point but I've forgotten
Anne-Marie: you can look for Sasha's slides back a few weeks ago
Anne-Marie: at our IC meetings
Anne-Marie: and we can discuss nest Tuesday still :)
Anne-Marie: I propose that you give a rehearsal in our meeting so you have comments from everyone...
Anne-Marie: p14: also put in your style
Anne-Marie: plots should be in the AN...
Anne-Marie: or ask Jim if not
