Datasets and trigger:
- turn-on from twiki!!

W+Z estimations
- control plots

Signal event selection:
- we should put a nice control plot or two, showing for example Mjj before cutting, + deltaPhi before cutting?!!
- should add a slide specifically on jets, given the importance in our final state ;) With PUjetid criteria, leading jet pT/eta control plots for example...!!

I think you could show also the results of W->tau from data, for completeness of the picture and because we did it now :)!!

You could add with a big "Preliminary" in front your current estimates for JES/JER for the W background to the table p14...

Still a bit of work but it'll be nice :)
